    Easy-to-use form for reserving tables.

    Validates user input to ensure proper functionality.

### State Management:

    React's state management ensures seamless interactions and updates.

### Local Storage Integration:

    Cached unavailable times and reservations are stored in the browserâ€™s local storage.

### Responsive Design:

    Adaptable layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

## Technologies Used

    React: Component-based architecture for efficient development.

    HTML5 & CSS3: Semantics and responsive design.
